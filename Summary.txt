Summary:

 1st Half of Semester:
 
  Regular Languages(Theory of computation Book):
  -We have DFAs, which are equivalent to NFAs
  -DFA and NFA can be described by reg expression
  -They are closed under union,intersection,star,complement
  -Proved pumping lemma...  
  
  Context-Free Languages(Theory of computation Book):
  -Where do we have context free grammars
  -CFG into Chomsky Normal Form
  -Non-Deterministic push down automata accepting cfg
  -Deterministic Push Down Automata -> Bison/yacc
  
  Church-Turing Thesis(Theory of computation Book):
  -Every computational process that is intuitivelu am algorithm
  can be converted to a turing machine:
    -Java/C/C++/Lamda Calc
  -GÃ¶delization: Bijection between Turing Machine and the set of natural numbers
    -Any n in N can be written in binary...

  With Turing Machine we see that(Theory of computation Book):
  -Multiple tapes are useless
  -Certain Languages cannot be decided
  -Certain real numbers cannot be computed
  -Certain languages cannot be decided and enumerable
  -The class of all languages is not countable
  -The class of all enumerable languages is countable
  -Rice's theorem: Nothing really interesting about languages can be decided (Turing Machines).
  
  Divide and Conquer Concept:
  -Talked about concept being applied to variety of problems
  
  Data Structures:
  -Hash Tables
  
  String Matching:
  -Chapter 32, Page 985:
    -Naive Algorithm
    -Rabin Karp
    -Knuth Morris Pratt
    
  Complexity(Theory of computation Book):
  -Complexity class P and NP
  -Non deterministic Algorithms
  -NP Complete Languages
